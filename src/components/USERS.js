    bio: `
    My career had me making technical presentations for companies
              nationwide. Toastmasters helped by giving me an environment to
              learn, try and fail safely. The positive feedback mechanisms built
              into the program help without causing me to feel badly about my
              speech. If you need to build your confidence or learn better
              methods then I would encourage you to give Toastmasters an honest
              try.
